/**
 * The closed value sets that both a form and the data layer need.
 *
 * This module imports **nothing**, on purpose. A `"use client"` form has to
 * render the options, and if it reached into a data module for them it would
 * pull the Postgres driver into the browser bundle — which is exactly the
 * failure `npm run build` catches and `next dev` does not.
 *
 * Each tuple mirrors a pg enum in `src/db/schema.ts`. `assertSameValues` in
 * the data modules proves at compile time that the two agree, so adding a
 * value to the database and forgetting it here is a type error, not a
 * silently missing option in a dropdown.
